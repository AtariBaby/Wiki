  - Chances are that if you have a new installation without any movies
    added you're going to have a view very similar to this. In order to
    have Radarr suggest any new movies to you you'll need to add
    something in order to give it a direction to suggest. You have
    several options:
    1.  Click on the [Add New Movie](Radarr_Library#Add_New "wikilink")
        button to add movies by hand.
    2.  Click on the [Import Existing
        Library](Radarr_Library#Library_Import "wikilink") button to
        import an existing library that you have collected
    3.  Click on the [Add Lists](Radarr_Settings#Lists "wikilink")
        button to add a list to Radarr
          - Some additional information about lists found
            [here](Radarr_FAQ#What_are_Lists_and_what_can_they_do_for_me? "wikilink")
