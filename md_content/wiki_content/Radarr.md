Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It
can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with
clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be
configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the
library when a better quality format becomes available.
