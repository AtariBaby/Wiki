### Write Metadata to Audio Files (Lidarr/Radarr)

#### Lidarr

<section begin=lidarr_settings_metadata_write_metadata_to_audio_files />

  -   - Tag Audio Files with Metadata - Here you can actually write
        metadata directly into the audio file. This can be useful for
        audio players as all the pertinent information to tell you will
        be hardcoded to the file.
      - Scrub Existing Tags - This will remove all existing metadata
        tags, this may be recommended as some people like to tag their
        name all over files and this will sanitize the files before
        being rewritten by Lidarr.
