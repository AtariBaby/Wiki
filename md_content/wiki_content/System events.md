### Events

#### Radarr

<section begin=radarr_system_events />

The events tab will show you what has been happening within your Radarr.
This can be used to diagnose some light issues. However, this does not
replace Trace Logs discussed in
[Logging](Radarr_Settings#logging "wikilink"). Events are the equivalent
of `INFO` Logs.

    has been triggered
-   Message - This column will tell you what message as been sent from
    the component from the previous column.
-   Gear Icon - This option will allow you to change how many
    Components/Messages are displayed per page (Default is 50)
-   Options at the top of the page
    -   Refresh - This option will refresh the current page, pulling a
        new events log
    -   Clear - This will clear the current events log allowing you to
        start from fresh
