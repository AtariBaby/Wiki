TThe **Wanted** -\> **Cutoff Unmet** section contains a list of the
episodes that have not yet reached their cut off. The cut off is set
within your [profiles](Sonarr_Settings#Profiles "wikilink")

:\* Tthe cut off is where you essentially tell Sonarr that the quality
of the video file is good enough for you and you no longer wish for
Sonarr to keep searching for better.

:\* There are a couple of options available to you on this page

:   [frameless\|none\|900px\|alt=Sonarr Cut off
    unmet](file:wanted-cut-off-unmet.png "wikilink")

1.  Search Selected - By selecting episodes on your list you can perform
    an **Automatic** search to try to see if there are any upgrades to
    your existing files.
2.  Unmonitor Selected - By selecting certain episodes on your list you
    can tell Sonarr to no longer look for any upgrades by
    **Unmonitoring** that episode.
3.  Seach All - This can be dangerous (depending on how big your list
    is) as you\'re telling Sonarr to search every file that hasn\'t met
    the cut off. This can be useful if you do not have a massive list.
4.  Filter - This will allow you to filter out your results. This is
    useful if you\'re wanting to search a specific set of episodes or
    series
