Sonarr

<section begin=sonarr_wanted />

The **Wanted** -\> **Missing** section contains a list of the episodes
you have marked to monitor that are missing from your disk (haven\'t
been downloaded yet).

Note: This will only include episodes completely missing from your disk,
not episodes which exist on disk, but have their cutoff profile unmet.

-   \"Search Selected\" - Here you can select certain episodes if you
    wish to search for them with your indexers
-   \"Unmonitor Selected\" - Here you can select certain episodes and
    unmonitor them if you\'re no longer interested in them.
-   \"Search All\" - Selecting here will send a search to all of your
    indexers for all current missing episodes. Once pressed, a dialog
    box will pop up with a warning to you, letting you know how many
    episodes will be searched for; this is particularly helpful to know
    if your indexers limit your api calls.
    -   **Note**: This search process cannot be cancelled once started
        without restarting Sonarr.
